# LCAT data module

## Summary

* This module contains classes to process CHESS-SCAPE NetCDF files and create a PostgreSQL database (or tables within).
* There is some setup required if you want to recreate the LCAT database. Please read the documentation at `research.lcat.public/docs` to get started.
* Once data has been downloaded and installed, run the example notebooks at `research.lcat.public/data/examples`.
